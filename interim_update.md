Our initial project plan was to cull available information from the MTA, Uber, the TLC, and CitiBike, and attempt to explain broad transportation trends in New York. Particularly, the relationship between ridesharing, cabs, mass transit, and bicycles.  Unfortunately, this proposal was a bit too broad in scope for a small project.  So, on recommendation of the professor, we have  tempered our ambitions and scaled our project back to focus on the relationship between yellow cabs and CitiBike--specifically, which routes through Manhattan are preferred for CitiBikes, and which are preferred for yellow cabs.
